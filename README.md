# Deep-Learning-on-Satellite-Imagery-
Comparative study of a custom CNN with ResNet-18 &amp; ResNet-50  for Tree Presence Classification in Satellite Imagery to support Green Space Mapping


This repository features three deep learning models—Custom CNN, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50—to compare accuracy, inference time, and computational cost. 
The primary goal is to identify the optimal model for real-time and large-scale tree classification, particularly in the context of developing areas.


# Prerequisites
To run the code, install the necessary libraries:

## Libraries Used
- **torch**: Deep learning library to build and train the model.
- **torchvision**: Provides pre-trained models and data transformations.
- **numpy**: Numerical operations and array manipulations.
- **matplotlib**: Plotting training and validation loss/accuracy.
- **pandas**: Data handling and analysis .
- **scikit-learn**: Metrics and performance evaluation.
