# Deep-Learning-on-Satellite-Imagery-
Comparative study of a custom CNN with ResNet-18 &amp; ResNet-50  for Tree Presence Classification in Satellite Imagery to support Green Space Mapping


This repository features three deep learning models—Custom CNN, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50—to compare accuracy, inference time, and computational cost. 
The primary goal is to identify the optimal model for real-time and large-scale tree classification, particularly in the context of developing areas.
Objectives

Develop and train three models (Custom CNN, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50) for tree presence classification.

Compare the models based on accuracy, inference time, and computational cost.

Demonstrate the potential of AI-driven green space mapping in promoting sustainability and environmental conservation.
